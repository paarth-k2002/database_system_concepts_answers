1. Interaction with the file manager : No DBMS can do without this. If there is no file manager interaction then nothing stored in the files can be retreived.
2. Integrity enforcement : Consistency constraints may not be satisfied. Eg. an instructor may belong to a non-existent department, two students may have same ID, account balances could go below the minimum allowed, etc.
3. Security enforcement : Unauthorized users may access the database, or users authorized to access parts of the database may be able to access parts of the database for which they lack authority. Eg. a low level user could get access to important secret codes, or low employee getting access to classified files of an organization.
4. backup and recovery : Data could be lost permanently, rather than at least being available in a consistent state that existed prior to a failure.
5. Concurrency control : Consistency Constraint may be voilated despite proper integrity enforcement in each tranasaction. Eg. incorrect bank balances might be reflected due to simultaneous withdrawls and deposists on the same account.
