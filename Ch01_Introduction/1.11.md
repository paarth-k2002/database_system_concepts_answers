The Transaction Manager, more specifically the concurrency-control manager.
The Transaction Isolation component of the database prevents both students from being given the last seat of the course. In database management system always ensures the data that enters into the database must maintain accuracy and consistency of the database system. 

Therefore, when both students register for the last seat of the course, there are two probabilities presents such as: S1 registers for last seat. S2 registers for last seat.
But there is no chance for the probabilty of :
Both students get the last seat. Not a single student gets last seat.
Above probabilities ensure that only one of the students would register for the last seat of the course.

The Transaction Isolation concept makes this possible. It ensures that only one student's registration request is fulfilled and database maintains accuracy and consistency.
