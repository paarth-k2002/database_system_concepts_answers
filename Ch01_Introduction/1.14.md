The variety of new data-intensive applications and the need for rapid development led to NoSQL systems.

**Pros of SQL**

1. Adjusted, standardised and affordable.
2. Adjusted, standardised and affordable
3. Availability of more SQL database-oriented product suites and integrations
4. Existing for a longer time, thus having a larger community and more support systems behind them
5. Operational atomicity
6. Easy rollbacks and setups
7. Compatibility when working with the right data types and information
8. Efficient with complex queries and ongoing query operations

**Cons of SQL**

1. Not efficient with large volumes of data
2. Database execution can sometimes be challenging
3. Complicated to use and SQL is more complex than modern document-oriented methods
4. Not scalable enough, especially horizontally
5. Lack of decentralisation and flexibility
6. Only effective with structured data
7. Requires more powerful hardware and better IT infrastructure
8. Slow compared to modern NoSQL-based systems
9. Not great for huge user loads or multiple concurrent operations

**Pros of NoSQL**

1. Decentralisation and adaptability
2. Flexible and easy to integrate with applications or development pipelines
3. More accessible and easy to use as a database
4. Adjustable according to operational requirements without hampering active operations or with minimal data movement
5. Enormous scalability and efficiency when working with big data or massive volumes of data
6. Supports structured, unstructured and semi-structured data
7. Can easily work on weaker hardware and simple IT architecture
8. Supports a massive number of concurrent users

**Cons of NoSQL**

1. Not effective with maintaining atomicity or accuracy, thus decreasing the trustworthiness of the information
2. NoSQL databases are more unorganised and can face attribution problems
3. Lack of standardisation
4. Lack of smooth transmutation or institutionalisation across other NoSQL databases. This makes it extremely tough to change one’s setup or move to another database system
5. Less support and fewer available frameworks to ensure a stable future for databases working on non-Linux systems
6. Slower upgrades and almost nonexistent product suites other than the ones offered by the NoSQL database service providers.
