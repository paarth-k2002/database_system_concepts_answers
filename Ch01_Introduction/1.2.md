> List five ways in which the type declaration system of a language such as Java or C++ differs from the
> data definition language used in a database.

1. Executing an action in DDL results in creation of an object in the database, while in a programming language the type declaration is simply an abstraction used in the program.
2. DDLs allow consistency constraints to be specific, which programming language type systems generally do not allow. These include domain constraints and referential integrity constraints.
3. DDLs support authorization, giving different access rights to different users. PL type systems do not provide such protection.
4. PL type systems are usually much richer than the SQL type system. Most databases support only basic types such as different types of numbers and strings, although some databases do support some complex types such as arrays and objects.
5. DDL is focused on specifying types of attributes of relations; in contrast, a programming language allows objects and collections of objects to be created.
