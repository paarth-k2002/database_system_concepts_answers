> List six major steps that you would take in setting up a database for a particular enterprise.

Six major steps in setting up a database for a particular enterprise are:

* Define the high-level requirements of the enterprise (this step generates a document known as the system requirements specification).
* Define a model containing all appropriate types of data and data relationships.
* Define the integrity constraints on the data.
* Define the physical level.
* For each known problem to be solved on a regular basis (e.g., tasks to be carried out by clerks or web users), define a user interface to carry out the task, and write the necessary application programs to implement the user interface.
* Create/initalize the database.

Integrity Constraints : These are set of rules that are used to maintain the quality of information. These insure that data insertion, updation, and other processes have to be performed in a way that data integrity is not affected.

Types : 

1. Domain constraint
2. Entity integrity contraints
3. Referential integrity constraints
4. Key constraints
