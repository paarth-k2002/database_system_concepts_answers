> Describe the differences in meaning between the terms _relation_ and _relation schema_.

---


Relation is defined as a set of n-tuples. A relation consists of a heading and a body. A heading isa set of attributes. A body (of an n-ary relation) is a set of n-tuples. The heading of the relation is also the heading of each of its tuples.

Relation Schema is defined as a set of attributes. Also known as a table schema, it can be thought of as the basic information describing a table or relation. It is the logical definition of a table. It defines what the name of the table is. This includes a set of column names, the data types associated with each column. It can be described as a blueprint of a database that outlines the way data is organised into tables. In a relational schema, each tuple is divided into fields called Domains.
