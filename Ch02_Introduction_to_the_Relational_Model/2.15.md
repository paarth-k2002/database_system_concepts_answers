a. $\Pi_{loan\_number}(\sigma_{amount > 10000}(loan))$

b. $\Pi_{ID}(depositor \bowtie_{depositor.account\_number = account.account\_number} (\sigma_{balance > 6000}(account)))$

c. $\Pi_{ID}(depositor \bowtie_{depositor.account\_number = account.account\_number} (\sigma_{balance > 6000 \wedge branch\_name = "Uptown"}(account) ))$
