> Discuss the relative merits of imperative, functional, and declarative languages.

---

**Merits of Imperative Language**

1. Easy to read.
2. Relatively easy to learn.
3. Conceptual model (solution path) is very easy for beginners to understand.
4. Characteristics of specific application can be taken into account.

**Merits of Functional Language**

1. Use of pure functions
2. Optimum transparency
3. Lazy evaluation
4. Enhanced Readability
5. Static Variables
6. Seamless Parallel Programming
7. Validating Functional Signatures

**Merits of Declarative Language**

1. Sort and efficient code
2. Can be implemented using methods not yet known at the time of programming
3. Easy optimization as implementation is controlled by an algorithm
4. Maintenance possible independent of application development
